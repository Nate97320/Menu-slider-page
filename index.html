    <h2>What is this page about?</h2>
    <p>
      A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a digital currency
      designed to work as a medium of exchange through a computer network
      that is not reliant on any central authority, such as a government or
      bank, to uphold or maintain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      individual coin ownership records are stored in a digital ledger,
      which is a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure
      transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and
      to verify the transfer of coin ownership.
    </p>

      Despite their name, cryptocurrencies are not necessarily considered to be
      currencies in the traditional sense and while varying categorical treatments
      have been applied to them, including classification as commodities, securities,
      as well as currencies, cryptocurrencies are generally viewed as a distinct asset
      class in practice. Some crypto schemes use validators to maintain the cryptocurrency.
      In a proof-of-stake model, owners put up their tokens as collateral. In return,
      they get authority over the token in proportion to the amount they stake. Generally,
      these token stakers get additional ownership in the token over time via network fees,
      newly minted tokens or other such reward mechanisms.

    <p>
    Cryptocurrency does not exist in physical form (like paper money) and is typically
    not issued by a central authority. Cryptocurrencies typically use decentralized control
    as opposed to a central bank digital currency (CBDC). When a cryptocurrency is minted
    or created prior to issuance or issued by a single issuer, it is generally considered centralized.
    When implemented with decentralized control, each cryptocurrency works through distributed ledger
    technology, typically a blockchain, that serves as a public financial transaction database.
